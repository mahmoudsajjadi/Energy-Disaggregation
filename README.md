# Energy Disaggregation

## Overview

Welcome to the Energy Disaggregation project! This initiative addresses the fascinating challenge of energy disaggregation, where the primary goal is to deconstruct a building's overall energy consumption into individual appliance-level contributions. Imagine having precise insights into how much energy your fridge, AC, or even that sneaky standby power drain is consuming from the grid!

Whether it's focusing on specific appliance categories, incorporating real-time monitoring, or utilizing novel data sources, our approach strives to:

1. **Empower consumers with granular insights:** Acquiring a detailed understanding of appliance-level energy usage empowers users with targeted interventions and behavioral changes, leading to a significant reduction in household energy consumption.

2. **Optimize energy management:** Real-time disaggregation data serves as a foundation for smart homes and appliances, enabling dynamic load balancing and cost-saving energy scheduling.

3. **Advance the field of disaggregation:** Through our exploration, we aim to contribute to the development of more accurate, efficient, and adaptable disaggregation techniques.
